// That password is being sent to the code that hashes the password in login route
// uses .compare to see if they match
// if match === gets a token --> with role: "admin"
// token is being sent back to Insomnia - and you can login as ADMIN role
// with this admin token, I can then change menu and stuff as long as middleware checks are passed

// in the terminal --- ran this for hashed password for admin:
// utils/hashedPasswordAdmin.js
// logs out my password...: Iamthebestadminever123
// and the hashed password...: $2b$10$sUG03vtb0eKJxUCpPMc76emGux.0QoCE81ee/z8WtVvnrT6KWt1P6
// copied hashed password into new user document on mongodb and created userId "admin-blabla" manually
